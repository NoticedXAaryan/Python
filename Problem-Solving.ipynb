    "Let’s say there are two people with a great friendship. Let’s name them Aaryan and Vachas. Now, Vachas wants to take a leave, but the other staff are also on leave. So, he is worried about his work in his absence. Aaryan volunteered to do his work in his absence, but he didn't had any past experience. However, both are from a similar field of work. So, Vachas devised a list in which he explained about every single task and also how to do it. Luckily, Vachas’s job wasn’t that hard. So, the list idea worked out, and Vachas got his leave while Aaryan did his work."
